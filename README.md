## 📌 Project Overview

LifeSafe is a decentralized healthcare record management system designed to enhance data security, patient control, and transparency in medical record handling.

Traditional healthcare systems rely on centralized databases, making them vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, and data tampering. LifeSafe introduces a blockchain-inspired architecture to provide secure, verifiable, and patient-controlled record management.
